# Pipeline for creating stock datasets, applying feature selection, and simulate stock portfolios using ML models.
This project is made for the Master thesis at NTNU:
_Comparative analysis of feature selection in stock price prediction_


## Structure
- Data: create datasets for given countries or list of exchanges
- Feature selection: implement and run feature selection methods on datasets created in Data
- Model: define and train ML models
- Evaluation: run simulations and calculate evaluation metrics for ML models

- results: folder containing result files from running simulations

## Scripts
All scripts should be run from root using the full paths:

- data/create_dataset.py
- feature_selection/run_feature_selection.py
- evaluation/run_simulation_suite.py
